  - Fix drawing bug.  Image is not drawn in the correct place if you drag a
    window over it, or after switching tabs, etc.  This is a Java bug, I
    think.
  - Optimize code
    - Break up container into zones, and only interact codons in each zone?
    - Make sure that Codons that are fully bonded only call interact() with 
       their partner codons
  - Support reading more configuration from files
    - Create some abstraction of the Codon's internal state so that state
      machines can be trivially read from a file.
