1. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

JohnnyVon is a project to produce self-replicating automata in a continuous
2D space.

JohnnyVon 2.0 adds a simple folding mechanism, to produce self-assembling
meshes from self-replicating chains.

It simulates a simple 2D physics-ish universe, with widgets called Codons
that interact under a fairly simple, plausible set of rules, and have the
replication of long strings of these Codons as an emergent behaviour of
these rules.

2. Installation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

JohnnyVon is a program written in Java.  Thus, it can be installed and run
anywhere where the Java SDK 1.3 is available.

  Note: In each set of instructions below, 
  - Replace / with \ if you run Windows.
  - Replace x.y with the JohnnyVon version that you downloaded
  - Replace ($START) with the directory where you saved the downloaded .jar 
    file.  (e.g. 
    ~/incoming/ on *nix systems 
    or 
    C:\My Downloads\ on Windows.)
  - Replace ($JAVABIN) with your Java SDK directory (something like
    /usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0/bin/ on *nix systems 
    or  
    C:\j2sdk1.4.0\bin\ on Windows systems.  
    This may be in your path, so you may not need to worry about it.)

A. Running ................................................................

  If your system is correctly set up, you should be able to do one of the
  following to run JohnnyVon directly from a downloaded .jar:
    - Double-click the JohnnyVon-x.y.jar file
      or
    - cd ($START)
      ($JAVABIN)java -jar JohnnyVon-x.y.jar
      You can add a --read parameter to tell JohnnyVon to read a file from
      standard input.  For example, if you have unpacked the archive (see 
      B. below) then you can append 
      " --read < support/input.txt" to read our custom input
      file, instead of using the default settings.

B. Unpacking ..............................................................

  cd ($START)
  ($JAVABIN)jar xf JohnnyVon-x.y.jar

  These will create a directory called JohnnyVon/ with all of the JohnnyVon
  files in it.
  
C. Building ...............................................................

	Building the easy way requires that you have Apache-Ant installed.  It
	can be found at <http://ant.apache.org/>
	
  cd ($START)
	ant compile

D. Generating Documentation ...............................................

  cd ($START)
	ant docs

  This will create documentation in the ($START)JohnnyVon/doc directory.
  
  Note: Although the source will compile and run on JDK 1.1, the
    documentation uses tags that are available only in JDK 1.4 or newer.

  Note: At this time, not all classes/methods are documented with Javadoc.
  
E. Repackaging ............................................................
  
  cd ($START)
	ant

  This should result in a .jar that is the basically the same as the one you
  downloaded.
